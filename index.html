                            Knowing the exact location of students has always been problematic. This comes more about when the lecturer need to know the number of students around campus. Lecturers sometimes leave their offices to attend to lectures only to find few students or not
                            even any in the lecture rooms. Group 10 brings you the live location tracking app where lecturers are able to create groups and add students who also have accounts with the app in order to see their current location. This then
                            helps a lecturer to know the turn up of students such that they decide whether to go for the lecture or wait a bit longer for the number of students to grow.

                            Currently Email/ Password based Authentication is used for user verification and registration supported by Fireabase Authentication. User is provided with option to create or join multiple groups with option to add or remove members anytime as per need.
                            Location of all the members in the group is shared collectively on a Common google maps Screen with the help of location markers. A Flutter project to allow users share their location among multiple groups and being able to
                            get updated about whereabouts of other group members simultaneously on a shared Google map screen.

                        <p>
                            <li>Google sign-in plugin — A plugin that makes the authentication and sign-in process easier</li>
                            <li>Firebase plugin — Provides easier access to the database and negates the need to use servers in the middle to handle requests</li>
                            <li>Google map view plugin — Provides a way to display map with markers

                        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                        <p>
                            Before we began, we made sure that we either have Android Studio, Visual Studio Code Editor, or IntelliJ IDE installed on your system. As a group, we recommend using VScode. We prefer VScode because its debugging and deploying features are extremely well
                            suited.
                            <br></br>
                            We also installed a few Flutter and Dart plugins to support our code editor.
                        </p>
                        <h2>User Interface</h2>
                        <li>When one opens the application they have to create an account with it if they are not signed up. In case one is registered with the application they just have to sign in with their details </li>
                        <img src="img/1.jpeg" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 200px;">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            On the interface of signing in one is required to provide an e-mail username and password
                        </li>
                        <img src="img/6.jpeg" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 200px;">
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <li>After signing in and authentication has been confirmed one has to continue to proceed with the rest of the application. This is shown in the user interface below </li>

                        <img src="img/8.jpeg" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 200px;">
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <li>
                            One has to search for members who are already registered with the application to form a group such that he or she can view their location.
                        </li>
                        <img src="img/3.jpeg" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 200px;">
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <li>After forming a group an interface with track location, hide settings, delete group and add members appears where one has to click on track location such that he is able to see the location of other members </li>
                        <img src="img/new.jpeg" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 200px;">
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <li>After clicking on track location a map displays which shows the location of other members who are on the application as well. One is able to see the location of friends or colleagues with whom they are in the same group </li>
                        <img src="img/7.jpeg" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 200px;">
                        <br>

                        This application is so far only designed to help lecturers track the turnup of students for lectures but the future plans are very big. we expect to extend the application to work in different sectors to improve tracking and monitoring. we also hope to
                        implement a chating system in the application to enable members in different groups commmunicate
