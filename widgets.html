                            The app works in such a way that users(students) create groups with the app and they are able to add a lecturer who has the account with th app as well such that he or she can track their location to know the number of students who have turned up for
                            the lecture before going there physically

                                    This application is soffer only designed to help lecturers track the turnup of students for lectures but the future plans are very big. we expect to extend the application to work in different sectors to improve tracking and monitoring. we also hope to
                                    implement a chating system in the application to enable members in different groups commmunicate

            <h1>Project Goals</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The project is an application whose purpose is to provide notification to the students as a lecture is about to begin and indicate the exact location where the lecture is to be held. On top of that the application also has a functionality
                for showing who is attending the lecture at a given time thus giving the lecture a significant way to measure the size of the class and determine who attended the lecture.
